# Bank Exit Probability Deep Learning

#### This is the source code of a [TechTalks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mifjMfOx7Dc) that I presented in [CWI Software](https://cwi.com.br/)

### Application

##### A simple Deep Learning to predict the probability of a customer leaving the bank. The dataset used is fictitious, but is based in reality.

### Setup

##### For this setup I'm using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) that is a Package Manager focus in Data Science.

- #### Installing Theano
`conda install theano`

- #### Installing Tensorflow
`conda install tensorflow`

- #### Installing Keras
`conda install keras`

- #### Tensorflow GPU 
###### Optional, not recommended for this application, because in this type of application the CPU(tensorflow already installed) will works better.

`conda install tensorflow-gpu`

### Running the application

##### Now you are ready to run the application, then like Kirill Eremenko of SuperDataScience says, Enjoy Deep Learning! üòÅ
